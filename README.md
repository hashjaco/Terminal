# My_Shell

## Author: Hashim Jacobs

My_Shell is a command line terminal built from scratch in C, using low-level system calls to navigate and manipulate file system. It is NOT fully secured, so I don't recommend using this as an alternative to your computer's built-in shell.

## Build Instructions: Simply type "make" into command line

## Run Instructions: Enter ./myshell
